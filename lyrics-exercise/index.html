<body class="lyrics">
<p>London 2020
Boy and a girl broke up, yeah, it's two a penny
And I been tryna make a big step forward
Saw you, it was awkward
Nothing like I thought would happen happened </p>

<p>I was so in love
And that don't come off in the wash
Kinda hope it does though
'Cause you're seeing someone pretty
And I hate her guts, so
I'll be telling you she's nice on the bus home </p>

<p>We were bad but we're gonna be good
It didn't work like I thought it would
And I resent you just a little if I'm honest
But one of us has gotta try to keep a promise
And I swore that I'd swallow my pride
And you swore you would do better this time
Well, I might be bitter and twisted
And broken and petty and lying
But at least I'm trying </p>

<p>At least I'm trying
At least I'm trying </p>

<p>Three shots, lemon drops
One for being lost and alone in your early twenties
One for being obsessed with someone who puts you secondary
One for calling guys with guitars in a cemetery
Just me?
Okay, if I'm being frank
I want a sorry but I'll settle for a handshake
'Cause I'm the baby
But I'm gonna be the bigger man, babe
So many blank slates I could build a whole fucking house </p>

<p>We were bad but we're gonna be good
It didn't work like I thought it would
And I resent you just a little if I'm honest
But one of us has gotta try to keep a promise
And I swore that I'd swallow my pride
And you swore you would do better this time
Well, I might be bitter and twisted
And broken and petty and lying
But at least I'm trying
At least I'm trying </p>

<p>Not friends
No, we're somewhere in between
'Cause you're awful and I miss you
And I killed you in my dream last night
Even then you didn't care
It's a low when even in my dreams you still don't want me there
Got friends
Got at least a healthy five
Yeah, some people think I'm funny, baby
Don't look so surprised
We think that your girlfriend is a bore
But we're nice to her in public
'Cause we're grown up and mature </p>

<p>Not friends
'Cause when I asked you on the train why you hurt me
And you couldn't really actually explain, I cried
Then I told you it was cool
God! You haven't changed at all </p>

<p>We were bad but we're gonna be good
It didn't work like I thought it would
And I resent you just a little if I'm honest
But one of us has gotta try to keep a promise
And I swore that I'd swallow my pride
And you swore you would do better this time
Well, I might be bitter and twisted
And broken and petty and lying
And you might be awful like all of the time, yeah
It's almost inspiring
But at least I'm trying</p>

<p>At least I'm trying
At least I'm trying  </p>
