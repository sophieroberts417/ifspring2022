            Grimpoteuthis is a genus of pelagic umbrella octopuses known as the dumbo octopuses. The name "dumbo" originates from their resemblance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film Dumbo, having a prominent ear-like fin which extends from the mantle above each eye. There are 15 species recognized in the genus. Prey include crustaceans, bivalves, worms and copepods. The average life span of various Grimpoteuthis species is 3 to 5 years.

                Welsh Corgis were once cattle herding dogs; a type of dog referred to as "heelers",
                meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move.
                Their low height off the ground and high agility would allow them to avoid being kicked
                <br /><br />
                The first recorded date for Corgis appearing in the show ring was in Wales is 1925.
                The first Championship was awarded at a Cardiff show in 1928, to a red and white
                Pembroke girl named Shan Fach.
                <br /><br />
                In 1933 the first Welsh Corgis were brought to the United States by a breeder named Mrs. Lewis Roesler.
                She had previously been well known for breeding Old English Sheepdogs.

            <p>
                There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke. Both were named for the
                county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several traits, such as their coats,
                which are water-resistant and shed on average twice a year. Both breeds also have short legs,
                and fox-like heads. However, the body of the Cardigan is slightly longer than the Pembroke;
                its head is also typically larger than that of a Pembroke and it has a larger nose.

            <p>
                According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health the two breeds of Corgi
                have similar lifespans: they both live over 12 years on average. Both breeds
                are relatively health, there main causes of death were canine cancer and old
                age. However, the Pembroke Corgi has higher rates of other health complications
                like kidney failure, and eye conditions.

            <p>
                Queen Elizabeth II has long been associated with Corgis. After a visit to Thomas Thynne,
                5th Marquess of Bath in 1933, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made it well known to their
                family that they liked the Corgis owned by the Marquess. Their father, Prince Albert, Duke of York,
                purchased the Pembroke Corgi Rozavel Golden Eagle, from the Rozavel kennels in Surrey. It was renamed Dookie.
                <br /><br />
                Corgis have also appeared on screen, stage and in novels.  In 1963, a Corgi was featured in
                the Walt Disney film Little Dog Lost, which led to an increase in popularity for the breed
                within the United States. In the anime Cowboy Bebop, the crew has a super-intelligent Pembroke
                Welsh Corgi, Ein, on their ship.

            <h2>Threats</h2>
            <p>
                Species of Grimpoteuthis are assumed to have a worldwide distribution, living in the cold, abyssal depths ranging from 1,000 to 7,000 metres. Specimens have been found off the coast of Oregon, the Philippines, Martha's Vineyard, the Azores, New Zealand, Australia, California, Gulf of Mexico, Papua, and New Guinea.
                <br /><br />
                Dumbo octopuses are the deepest living octopuses known, with some specimens captured or observed in hadal depths. One Grimpoteuthis sp. specimen was captured 60 km southeast of Grand Cayman at 7,279 m, but this depth is uncertain (as the specimen may have been captured while the net was descending to depth). However, in 2020, Grimpoteuthis was spotted 6,957 m deep in the Java Trench, confirming the hadal distribution of this genus.

            <h2>Movement, characteristics, food supply</h2>
            <p>
                Specimens of Grimpoteuthis have been observed to swim by using movement of the fins. Although it has been suggested that species of Grimpoteuthis are capable of jet-propulsion, this has since been deemed unlikely. Movement of the arms can be used to help the animal move in any direction. Despite being thought of as a myth, the gills of the Grimpoteuthis tend to assist the organism in propelling in, or away in various directions, even if it isn't by much. In addition to the propelling, this animal can also balloon away from high intensity or stressful situations.
                <br /><br />
                The arms permit the animal to crawl along the seafloor, to capture prey, lay eggs, explore, etc. Dumbos hover above the sea floor, searching for polychaete worms, pelagic copepods, isopods, amphipods, and other crustaceans for food. Prey is captured by pouncing on the target, which then is swallowed whole. In contrast to other octopuses, dumbo octopuses do not produce ink. This makes sense considering the fact that their habitat is a deep, dark place in the ocean.

            <h2>Breeding</h2>
            <p>
                The cirrate octopuses are classified as 'continuous spawners', females carry multiple eggs in various stages of maturation and only lay one-or-two eggs at a time, with no seasonality in spawning (however most of these aspects of reproductive biology have only been confirmed in Opisthoteuthis, not Grimpoteuthis). Mating in cirrate octopuses has never been observed, and unlike other octopuses, members of Cirrata lack a hectocotylus for the transfer of sperm packets. Cirrate octopus eggs are large and have a tough casing surrounding the chorion (not found in other octopuses), and Grimpoteuthis in particular attach their eggs to deep sea corals (octocorals).[35] The female cirrate octopus does not guard or incubate the eggs (again unlike other octopuses). Grimpoteuthis hatchlings emerge as "fully competent" juveniles with all of the sensory and motor features to survive on their own.
                <br /><br />
                Sexual dimorphism between males and females are less noticeable and consistent in Grimpoteuthis compared to other cirrate octopuses (such as Opisthoteuthis). In some species (e.g., G. bathynectes and G. discoveryi) the males have enlarged suckers relative to the females, but no such enlargement is found in other Grimpoteuthis species.
