    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the butter in tablespoons and place them in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, reduce the heat to low and continue cooking, until the solids sink to the bottom of the pan and turn golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and pour the browned butter into a small bowl. Stir the vanilla and lemon zest into the butter, then set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>
            In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside until needed.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs at medium speed while gradually adding the sugar. Once all of the sugar has been added, increase the speed to medium-high and continue whipping the mixture until it's very thick and pale in color, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the mixer off and, using a silicon spatula, fold in the flour mixture in three additions, stirring just until combined. Fold in the butter mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to 2 days.</li>
        <li>30 minutes before you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees (F). Generously brush the molds of your madeleine pan with butter, then lightly dust with flour.</li>
        <li>Using a medium cookie scoop, spoon level scoops of the batter into the center of each mold. You don't need to spread the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12 minutes, or until the "bellies" have risen and they're golden brown.</li>
        <li>Cool madeleines in the pan placed on a cooling rack for a minute or two, then gently loosen them from the molds. If they stick, carefully run a small knife around the edge of the cakes until they release.</li>
        <li>Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve warm, with coffee or tea</li>
    </ol>

        <p>This website layout makes it easy to find a recipe and the aesthetic is clean. There is a lot of text to scroll through on the recipe pages, which I personally do not like. </p>
        <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com">All Recipes</a>
        <p>This website's homepage is very inviting and is useful for people who don't know what to cook because there are a lot of options. The menu with images at the top is really helpful.</p> 
        <a href="https://www.recipegirl.com">Recipe Girl</a>
        <p>This site has more aesthetic branding which is inviting, however there are some odd spacing conditions on the front page. For example, the logo is too big and smushes up against the image below.</p>
        <a href="https://www.glossier.com">Glossier</a>
        <p>Glossier's site has cohesive branding and the site uses a dynamic layout to display all of their products.</p>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a> 
        <p>I have noted this site before for its design. I think its use of topographical hierarchy specifically can inform my design.</p>
        <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a>
        <p>Netflix's use of horizontal scrolling is useful for the user to have easy access to a lot of imagery and info, but without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
