        <li>I am taking this class because I am interested in learning more about UX design and the basics of the coding that is used to create webpages.</li>
        <li>I have some experience with Java, but no other languages. I took an intro comp sci course freshman year which went over the basics of Java. </li>
        <li>I hope to learn how to code a basic multi page app (that looks good) in this course.</li>
        <li>I am expecting to use layout grids more when designing for screens than for paper. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> I think Pinterest exemplifies effective design because the layout of the site fits well with the companies overall goal. The site is meant to be a place for curated digital visual inspiration. The simple layout of "boards" that continues to refresh as the user scrolls down provides an enjoyable, inspiring experience.  </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple Store</a> I think the Apple Store site has good communication because it uses strong visuals and typography to communicate a lot of product information in a digestible way. Because of how the site breaks up type and uses hierarchy to include a lot of information for each product, I do not feel overwhelmed as a user by all of the information. </li>
        <li><a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> I think Google Calendar is a website that works really well because it is really user friendly. As someone who does not use many Google products, I find the interface really easy to get used to. The site is overall very simple, which makes it easy to use, but still highly customizable, which makes it enjoyable to use.</li>
